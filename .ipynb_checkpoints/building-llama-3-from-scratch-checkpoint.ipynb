Pre-normalization Using RMSNorm:\n","In the LLaMA 3 approach which is the same as LLaMA 2, a technique called RMSNorm is used for normalizing the input of each transformer sub-layer.\n","\n","Imagine you're studying for a big exam, and you have a massive textbook full of chapters. Each chapter represents a different topic, but some chapters are more crucial for understanding the subject than others.\n","Now, before diving into the entire textbook, you decide to evaluate the importance of each chapter. You don't want to spend the same amount of time on every chapter; you want to focus more on the critical ones.\n","This is where Pre-normalization using RMSNorm comes into play for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. It's like assigning a weight to each chapter based on its significance. Chapters that are fundamental to the subject get higher weights, while less important ones get lower weights.\n","\n","So, before going deeply into studying, you adjust your study plan based on the weighted importance of each chapter. You allocate more time and effort to the chapters with higher weights, ensuring you grasp the core concepts thoroughly.\n","\n","![N](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1000/0*GIr8bvByN_iAGQBW.png)\n","\n","Similarly, Pre-normalization using RMSNorm helps LLMs prioritize which parts of the text are more critical for understanding the context and meaning. It assigns higher weights to essential elements and lower weights to less crucial ones, ensuring the model focuses its attention where it's most needed for accurate comprehension. Interested readers can explore the detailed implementation of RMSNorm here."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### 2. SwiGLU Activation Function:\n","LLaMA introduces the SwiGLU activation function, drawing inspiration from PaLM.\n","\n","Imagine you're a teacher trying to explain a complex topic to your students. You have a big whiteboard where you write down key points and draw diagrams to make things clearer. But sometimes, your handwriting might not be very neat, or your diagrams might not be perfectly drawn. This can make it harder for your students to understand the material.\n","\n","Now, imagine if you had a magic pen that automatically adjusted the size and style of your handwriting based on how important each point is. If something is really crucial, the pen writes it bigger and clearer, making it stand out. If it's less important, the pen writes it smaller, but still legible.\n","SwiGLU is like that magic pen for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Before generating text, SwiGLU adjusts the importance of each word or phrase based on its relevance to the context.

Rotary Embeddings (RoPE):\n","Rotary Embeddings, or RoPE, is a type of position embedding used in LLaMA 3.\n","\n","Imagine you're in a classroom, and you want to assign seats to students for group discussions. Typically, you might arrange the seats in rows and columns, with each student having a fixed position. However, in some cases, you want to create a more dynamic seating arrangement where students can move around and interact more freely.\n","\n","ROPE is like a special seating arrangement that allows students to rotate and change positions while still maintaining their relative positions to each other. Instead of being fixed in one place, students can now move around in a circular motion, allowing for more fluid interactions.\n","\n","In this scenario, each student represents a word or token in a text sequence, and their position corresponds to their position in the sequence. Just like how ROPE allows students to rotate and change positions, ROPE allows the positional embeddings of words in a text sequence to dynamically change based on their relative positions to each other.\n","So, when processing text, instead of treating positional embeddings as fixed and static, ROPE introduces a rotational aspect, allowing for more flexible representations that capture the dynamic relationships between words in the sequence. This flexibility helps models like ChatGPT better understand and generate text that flows naturally and maintains coherence, similar to how a dynamic seating arrangement fosters more interactive discussions in a classroom. Those interested in the mathematical details can refer to the RoPE paper."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### 4. Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) Algorithm\n","\n","LLaMA 3 uses Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) from the tiktoken library introduced by OpenAI, whereas the LLaMA 2 tokenizer BPE is based on the sentencepiece library.

Suppose we have a text corpus with the words: \"ab\", \"bc\", \"bcd\", and \"cde\". We begin by initializing our vocabulary with all the individual characters in the text corpus, so our initial vocabulary is {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\"}.\n","\n","Next, we calculate the frequency of each character in the text corpus. For our example, the frequencies are: {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 3, \"c\": 3, \"d\": 2, \"e\": 1}.\n","\n","Now, we start the merging process. We repeat the following steps until our vocabulary reaches the desired size:\n","\n","1. First, we find the most frequent pair of consecutive characters. In this case, the most frequent pair is \"bc\" with a frequency of 2. We then merge this pair to create a new subword unit \"bc\". After merging, we update the frequency counts to reflect the new subword unit. The updated frequency is {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 2, \"d\": 2, \"e\": 1, \"bc\": 2}. We add the new subword unit \"bc\" to our vocabulary, which now becomes {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"bc\"}.\n","\n","2. We repeat the process. The next most frequent pair is \"cd\". We merge \"cd\" to form a new subword unit \"cd\" and update the frequency counts. The updated frequency is {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 1, \"d\": 1, \"e\": 1, \"bc\": 2, \"cd\": 2}. We add \"cd\" to the vocabulary, resulting in {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"bc\", \"cd\"}.\n","\n","3. Continuing the process, the next frequent pair is \"de\". We merge \"de\" to form the subword unit \"de\" and update the frequency counts to {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 1, \"d\": 1, \"e\": 0, \"bc\": 2, \"cd\": 1, \"de\": 1}. We add \"de\" to the vocabulary, making it {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"bc\", \"cd\", \"de\"}.\n","\n","4. Next, we find \"ab\" as the most frequent pair. We merge \"ab\" to form the subword unit \"ab\" and update the frequency counts to {\"a\": 0, \"b\": 1, \"c\": 1, \"d\": 1, \"e\": 0, \"bc\": 2, \"cd\": 1, \"de\": 1, \"ab\": 1}. \n","\n","5. We add \"ab\" to the vocabulary, which becomes {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"bc\", \"cd\", \"de\", \"ab\"}.\n","\n","6. Then, the next frequent pair is \"bcd\". We merge \"bcd\" to form the subword unit \"bcd\" and update the frequency counts to {\"a\": 0, \"b\": 0, \"c\": 0, \"d\": 0, \"e\": 0, \"bc\": 1, \"cd\": 0, \"de\": 1, \"ab\": 1, \"bcd\": 1}. We add \"bcd\" to the vocabulary, resulting in {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"bc\", \"cd\", \"de\", \"ab\", \"bcd\"}.\n","\n","7. Finally, the most frequent pair is \"cde\". We merge \"cde\" to form the subword unit \"cde\" and update the frequency counts to {\"a\": 0, \"b\": 0, \"c\": 0, \"d\": 0, \"e\": 0, \"bc\": 1, \"cd\": 0, \"de\": 0, \"ab\": 1, \"bcd\": 1, \"cde\": 1}. We add \"cde\" to the vocabulary, making it {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"bc\", \"cd\", \"de\", \"ab\", \"bcd\", \"cde\"}.\n","\n","This technique can improve the performance of LLMs and handle rare and out-of-vocabulary words. The big difference between TikToken BPE and sentencepiece BPE is that TikToken BPE doesn't always split words into smaller parts if the whole word is already known. For example, if \"hugging\" is in the vocabulary, it stays as one token instead of splitting into [\"hug\",\"ging\"]."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Setting the Stage\n","We will be working with a small range of Python libraries, but it's better to install them to avoid encountering \"no module found\" errors."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-27T02:56:41.674943Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-27T02:56:41.674503Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-27T02:56:56.698775Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-27T02:56:56.697490Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-27T02:56:41.674901Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Requirement already satisfied: sentencepiece in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (0.2.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: tiktoken in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (0.7.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: torch in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (2.1.2+cpu)\n","Requirement already satisfied: blobfile in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (2.1.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: matplotlib in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (3.7.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: huggingface_hub in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (0.22.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: regex>=2022.1.18 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from tiktoken) (2023.12.25)\n","Requirement already satisfied: requests>=2.26.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from tiktoken) (2.31.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: filelock in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from torch) (3.13.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: typing-extensions in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from torch) (4.9.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: sympy in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from torch) (1.12)\n","Requirement already satisfied: networkx in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from torch) (3.2.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: jinja2 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from torch) (3.1.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: fsspec in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from torch) (2024.2.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pycryptodomex~=3.8 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from blobfile) (3.20.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.25.3 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from blobfile) (1.26.18)\n","Requirement already satisfied: lxml~=4.9 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from blobfile) (4.9.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: contourpy>=1.0.1 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from matplotlib) (1.2.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: cycler>=0.10 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from matplotlib) (0.12.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: fonttools>=4.22.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from matplotlib) (4.47.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: kiwisolver>=1.0.1 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from matplotlib) (1.4.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy<2,>=1.20 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from matplotlib) (1.26.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: packaging>=20.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from matplotlib) (21.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pillow>=6.2.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from matplotlib) (9.5.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pyparsing>=2.3.1 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from matplotlib) (3.1.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.7 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from matplotlib) (2.9.0.post0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pyyaml>=5.1 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from huggingface_hub) (6.0.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: tqdm>=4.42.1 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from huggingface_hub) (4.66.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: six>=1.5 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from python-dateutil>=2.7->matplotlib) (1.16.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from requests>=2.26.0->tiktoken) (3.3.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from requests>=2.26.0->tiktoken) (3.6)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from requests>=2.26.0->tiktoken) (2024.2.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: MarkupSafe>=2.0 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from jinja2->torch) (2.1.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: mpmath>=0.19 in /opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages (from sympy->torch) (1.3.0)\n"]}],"source":["!pip install sentencepiece tiktoken torch blobfile matplotlib huggingface_hub"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["After installing the required libraries, we need to download some files.
